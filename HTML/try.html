    <p>
      Italian cuisine (Italian: Cucina italiana) is a
      <strong>Mediterranean cuisine</strong> consisting of the <u>ingredients</u>,
      <u>recipes</u> and <u>cooking techniques</u> developed across the Italian Peninsula since
      antiquity, and later spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora.<br />
      Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of
      <u>potatoes</u>, <u>tomatoes</u>, <u>capsicums</u>, <u>maize</u> and <u>sugar beet</u> — the
      latter introduced in quantity in the <strong>18th century</strong>. It is one of the
      best-known and most appreciated gastronomies worldwide

    <h2>Spaghetti</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta">pasta</a>. It is a staple food of traditional
      Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is
      <u> made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals </u>.
      <strong>Italian spaghetti</strong> is typically made from durum wheat semolina. Usually the
      pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added.
      <strong>Spaghettoni</strong> is a thicker form of spaghetti, while capellini is a very thin
      spaghetti.

    <h1>Spiders</h1>
    <p>
      Snakes are some of the most <strong>feared</strong> animals, up there with spiders and
      centipedes for many. Some people even suffer from ophidiophobia, an intense fear of snakes.
      This fear is not unfounded. Our bodies have evolved to fear animals that could potentially
      harm us, and some snakes certainly can be deadly.
